# Installation

- Before OpenCV installation, you must first install some needed dependences with the following instruction:

> $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff4-dev libjasper-dev libopenexr-dev cmake python-dev python-numpy python-tk libtbb-dev libeigen3-dev yasm libfaac-dev libopencore-amrnb-dev libopencore-amrwb-dev libtheora-dev libvorbis-dev libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libqt4-dev libqt4-opengl-dev sphinx-common texlive-latex-extra libv4l-dev libdc1394-22-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev default-jdk ant libvtk5-qt4-dev

- For opencv installation, type on your console:

> $ cd ~

> $ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-unix/2.4.9/opencv-2.4.9.zip

> $ unzip opencv-2.4.9.zip

## Workspace compilation

It is needed to compile the workspace before running face and eyes recognition. For doing it, first go to downloaded workspace using
> cd opencv

Then run this command to make the compilation wich will generate *build* and *devel* folders, needed to run the program.

> catkin_make

This project is intended to detect the face and eyes of a person getting the images from PC camera and sending it through a ROS topic. OpenCV 2.4.9 is the library that will be used for doing it.

## Templates

The following templates are the base for this project:

1. opencv_template_node: This is the base template wich serves as an example of how OpenCV works with images, it contains the basic processing from taking the images by subscribing to camera node, converting them from ROS format to OpenCV format
, drawing an example circle, showing the processed image and publishing it trough a ROS topic, for wich it is necessary to convert to ROS format again.
2. opencv_template_node_hh: This template is pretty the same than the previous one, but implementing some defines and improving the original documentation.
3. opencv_grayImage_hh: This template shows how to convert an RGB color image to a gray scale one, for wich it uses cvtcolor function.
4. opencv_smoothingImages_hh: The objective of this template is to reduce the size of the image, it helps to reduce the time needed to process the image, due to a reduction on its resolution and it serves to avoid false positives on face and eyes detection.
5. Opencv_ChangeContrast: On this template, parameters alpha and beta are modified, changing the contrast of the image this way, this is useful for the program can recognize shapes more easily.
6. opencv_houghCircleTransform_hh: This template mix all previous templates for a greater implementation. With fully processed image (in the order they were described below) the program uses houghcircle method to find circles on the processed image, with this information, it draws a cirle on the original image.

**For executing this templates, this line must be executed from the console:**

> $ rosrun <folder_name>  <template_name>.cpp

## **Face and eyes recognition**

# Some needed changes before running main program

 - Change  your XML file direction (opencv-2.4.9/data/haarcascades) on the following lines:

> std::string face_cascade_name = "/home/mauricio/opencv/src/opencv_example/src/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml"; 

> std::string eyes_cascade_name = "/home/mauricio/opencv/src/opencv_example/src/haarcascade_eye_tree_eyeglasses.xml";

To execute the program, run the following command:

> roslaunch opencv_example opencv_example_testing.launch 

If you want to add any other node on the package, you must write this on opencv/src/opencv_example/CMakeList.txt:

> add_executable(<file_name> src/<file_name>.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(<file_name>
   ${OpenCV_LIBRARIES} # OPENCV
   ${catkin_LIBRARIES} # dejarlo

**General stability depends on enviroment illumination**

**Eyes recognition stability depends on distance from the camera**
